<p>Devon is a very rural county, made up of hilly landscapes, coastal cliffs and sandy shores. 
    As mentioned above, there are two National Parks in Devon, one being Dartmoor, which is 
    the largest open space in Southern England. Here youâ€™ll find granite tors, which entice 
    walkers of all abilities to the area. The second is Exmoor, which lies in both Devon and 
    Somerset, and is a large stretch of open moorland.</p>
