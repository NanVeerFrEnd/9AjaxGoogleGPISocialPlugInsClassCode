<p>The name Devon derives from the name of the Brythons who inhabited the southwestern peninsula of Britain 
at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain known as the Dumnonii, thought to mean 'deep valley dwellers' 
from proto Celtic *dubnos 'deep'. In the Brittonic, Devon is known as Welsh: Dyfnaint, Breton: Devnent and 
Cornish: Dewnens, each meaning 'deep valleys'. Among the most common Devon placenames is -combe which derives
 from Brittonic cwm meaning 'valley' usually prefixed by the name of the possessor. </p>
